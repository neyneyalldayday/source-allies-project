# source-allies-project
a little project sent over to be by source allies

The point here is to take a text file with the entire manuscript of moby dick and return the top one hundred words 
used in the book and how many times they are used.

some words have to be filtered out by the provided stop words text file.

originally was gonna put everything in a database and just query it but i though after set up
that may be a little too easy with an sql query.

so i loaded each text file into a really big string and then broke it down and chaged the datatype a few times to 
arrive at the key value pair for the requirement. 

pretty fun overal
